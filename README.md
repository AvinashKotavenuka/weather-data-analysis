# 📊 Weather Data Analysis – Play Decision Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project using **Pandas** and **Seaborn**. The goal is to understand how weather conditions — such as outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind — affect the decision to play (yes or no).

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
**Source**: `weather.csv`  
**Columns**:
- `outlook`: sunny / overcast / rainy  
- `temperature`: hot / mild / cool  
- `humidity`: high / normal  
- `windy`: True / False  
- `play`: yes / no  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ✅ What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas  
- Explored patterns between weather conditions and play decision  
- Used `groupby`, filtering, and value counts to derive insights  
- Created visualizations for:
  - Distribution of decisions  
  - Outlook vs play  
  - Wind/humidity effects  
- Drew conclusions based on data patterns  

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- People tend to **not play** when it’s **sunny and humid**  
- **Overcast** days show a strong tendency to **play**  
- **Windiness** combined with certain outlooks also affects the decision
